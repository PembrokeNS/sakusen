libsakusen-resources is a library for managing the data for the game sakusen.
It is intended that clients and servers can use it to manage their needs for
loading / downloading / saving data such as maps and unitsets.

Possibly the library will also manage savegames and replays.

To compile, requires either libsakusen to be checked out in a parallel
directory called libsakusen or else for things to be laid out as in the
repository.
