Kiai requires a working install of python (probably needs to be version 2.5),
with the PyQt4 python bindings for Qt4 installed (available from 
http://www.riverbankcomputing.co.uk/pyqt/, and
in turn depending on Qt itself; a windows binary package of all of these is available at
http://www.riverbankcomputing.com/Downloads/PyQt4/GPL/PyQt-Py2.5-gpl-4.3.3-2.exe).
It also requires the python bindings for sakusen to be installed; these should
be built automaticly if your config.mk is set appropriately (they require only
python (with its development files) and SWIG (from http://www.swig.org/;
windows binary of version 1.3.31 is probably
http://prdownloads.sourceforge.net/swig/swigwin-1.3.31.zip). Note that swig
versions 1.3.32 and 1.3.33 appear to be broken.
With these installed, appropriate config.mk settings should lead to the .ui
files herein being compiled into .py files in the course of a normal "make";
this is the only compilation necessary.
To use, simply run "kiai.py". The convenience script
"run-kiai-from-builddir.sh" is made to allow running kiai without having
installed the python bindings for sakusen.

Good luck

For windows: 
Install binary package mentioned above. Edit C:\program files\python25\pyuic4.bat so that it refers to where your python directory actually is. Go to: cpp\trunk\kiai 
Run: "for %i in (*.ui) do "C:\Program files\python25\pyuic4.bat" -o %~ni.py %i"
Which does it for all *.ui files.
Move bindings/sakusen*.p into the kiai directory. 
Move python-bindings.dll into the kiai directory four times, renaming it to _sakusen.pyd,_sakusencomms.pyd,_sakusenresources.pyd,_sakusenclient.pyd.
Run python kiai.py
