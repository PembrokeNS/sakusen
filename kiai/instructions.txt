Kiai requires a working install of python 3, probably 3.1 or above,
with the KDE4 python bindings installed (and their various dependencies: most immediately PyQt4, and of course KDE4 (and therefore Qt4)).
It also requires pyqwt (and therefore qwt). Opengl must be enabled for PyQt4.
It also requires the python bindings for sakusen to be installed; these should
be built automaticly if your config.mk is set appropriately (they require only
python (with its development files) and SWIG (from http://www.swig.org/;
windows binary of version 1.3.31 is probably
http://prdownloads.sourceforge.net/swig/swigwin-1.3.31.zip).
With these installed, appropriate config.mk settings should lead to the .ui
files herein being compiled into .py files in the course of a normal "make";
this is the only compilation necessary.
To use, simply run "kiai.py". The convenience script
"run-kiai-from-builddir.sh" is made to allow running kiai without having
installed the python bindings for sakusen.

Good luck

For windows: 
Install binary package mentioned above (PyQT). Edit C:\program files\python25\pyuic4.bat so that it refers to where your python directory actually is. Go to: cpp\trunk\kiai 
Try running buildkiai.bat, and then python kiai.py. If that doesn't work, try:
Run: "for %i in (*.ui) do "C:\Program files\python25\pyuic4.bat" -o %~ni.py %i"
Which does its thing for all *.ui files.
Move bindings/_sakusen*.py into the kiai directory. 
Move _sakusen.pyd,_sakusen_comms.pyd,_sakusen_resources.pyd,_sakusen_client.pyd into the kiai directory.
Move dlls from the release dir into the kiai dir until kiai stops complaining about missing dlls. You will need at least libsak, libsak-comms, libsak-res, libsak-client, pcre, pcrecpp, stlport, boost, mhash, libpng, and liboptimal.
Run python kiai.py
