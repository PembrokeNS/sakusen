This is a slight modification of the pcrecpp code from the pcre library.  This
code was originally contributed by Google, and has been altered to allow it to
compile with Visual C++ 2005, when linked against the windows port of the pcre
library.

To compile this, you must install the Windows port of pcre (see Google), and
add appropriate include and libarry paths to the Visual C++ configurations.
These paths will be something like C:\Program Files\GnuWin32\include and
C:\Program Files\GnuWin32\lib respectively.
