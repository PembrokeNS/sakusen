We have some coding style issues to resolve:
- Do we indent inside 'public:' blocks, etc.
- Do enumeration names start with a capital? (John's do, ZuluOne's don't)
- How are enumeration members named (John prefers a common prefix on all
  members of an enumeration to avoid using up our namespace too quickly)
- Do constructors/destructors go before or after the private fields
- Do we put spaces just inside braces?  For example:
    uint16 getEnergyCost(void) const {return energyCost;}
  vs.
    uint16 getEnergyCost(void) const { return energyCost; }
