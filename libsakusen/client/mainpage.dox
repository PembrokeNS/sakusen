\brief libsakusen-client: Core client library

libsakusen-client is a library intended to ease the creation of sakusen
clients.  It provides code to process the messages received from the server and
use them to maintain the player's current knowledge of the gamestate, while
simultaneously allowing client programmers to add what functionality they
desire for their particular interface (or AI, etc.).
