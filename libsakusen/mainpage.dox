\brief libsakusen: The core sakusen library.

libsakusen is the core of Sakusen. It defines the entities involved in the game
(weapons, units, clients, etc.) and how they interact. It is anticipated that
all Sakusen clients and servers will use libsakusen; thus, it must be kept as
fast as possible.
