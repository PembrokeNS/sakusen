/** \page nonreproducibility Non-Reproducibility

Since we obviously want replays to work properly (unlike the majority), I'm
concerned about the reproducibilty of the game engine.  If everything is
perfectly reproducible then it would suffice to store in the replay the initial
game state, map scripting, and all incoming orders from clients to be able to
reconstruct the game entirely.  So far the following possible sources of
non-reproducibility concern me:

\section fp Floating point arithmetic

This occurs in two places so far:

- In orientation matrices, which are 3x3 double arrays.  A possible solution
  in this case would be to use sint32s as fixed precision values with only a
  couple of bits to the left of the decimal point.  This would work because
  orientation matrix entries are guaranteed to lie in the range [-1,1].

- In the computation of vector lengths.  I see no solution here, but I'm sure
  there exist integer arithmetic algorithms to do anything we want to do with
  vector lengths.

I talked to a programmer who writes software that models conservatories, and he
had in the past hit this problem with floating point arithmetic.  He was forced
to write his own implementation of floating point numbers to solve this
problem.
