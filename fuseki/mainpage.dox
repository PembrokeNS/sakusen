/** \namespace fuseki
\brief Experimental game server

Fuseki is a C++ Sakusen server that currently aims to serve through a Unix
socket (see unix(7)). In time it will serve over real network sockets.

Currently, it allows players to connect and observe the game. However, the game
is always the same, because it does not yet let clients control units. In time
it will allow you to play the game, using one of a wide range of clients. Time
passes.
