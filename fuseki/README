fuseki is a C++ Sakusen server that currently aims to serve through a Unix
socket (see unix(7)).

To compile, requires either both libsakusen and libsakusen-comms checked out in
appropriately named parallel directories or else for things to be laid out as
in the repository.

Also the following libraries:

PCRE libpcre-dev


The following valgring command may be of use to others as it was to me whilst
debugging fuseki:

valgrind --track-fds=yes --leak-check=full --gen-suppressions=yes --show-reachable=yes --suppressions=../tools/valgrind/sakusen.supp --log-fd=1 --db-attach=yes ./fuseki -fd-
