sakusen.supp suppresses various valgrind errors I got whilst trying to debug
fuseki.  They are:
- Problems deep inside the system implementation of dlopen, so not really
  anything we can fix.
Also provided is resident.supp:
- Memory allocated by libltdl and the things it calls pertaining to modules
  which are made resident and thus must exist until the end of execution and so
  never have their memory properly freed.
