liboptimal is a library for parsing options in configuration files or on the
command line.  Although several such libraries already exist, none of the
others appear to be truly C++ based, or offer all the features that liboptimal
does (of course, the do tend to offer features that liboptimal doesn't).

Since all sensible names for such libraries are already taken, I chose the
first word that came to mind beginning with 'opt'.
